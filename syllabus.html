		<p>Application Development </p>

		<blockquote>

		<p> Knowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas, you&rsquo;ll be able to implement them&hellip;  It&rsquo;s a big advantage, when you&rsquo;re considering an idea like putting a college facebook online, if instead of merely thinking &ldquo; That&rsquo;s an interesting idea,&rdquo; you can think instead &ldquo; That&rsquo;s an interesting idea. I&rsquo;ll try building an initial version tonight.&rdquo; </p>

		<h2> Why </h2>

		<p class = "impt">The new reality is that every company is a software company. Even in traditionally brick-and-mortar industries, software is performing more and more of the work. And, of course, many companies (especially &ldquo;lean startups&rdquo;) are purely software-based.</p>

		<p>Lacking an understanding of how software works while working in a software world puts you at a disadvantage. In this course, you will build a functional prototype of a software application. <span class= "highlighted"> To do this, you will learn the Ruby on Rails web application framework,</span> but our higher-level goals are to:</p>

		<ol>
		<li>Understand the general, platform-independent patterns of how applications work.</li>
		<li>Communicate more effectively and credibly with developers on our teams.</li>
		<li>Develop a builder&lsquo;s eye for problems that can be solved with technology.</li>
		<li>Prioritize features more intelligently by developing a better feel for their costs.</li>
		<li>Be able to make and test small changes to an application yourself.</li>
		<li>Become familiar with the agile development technique.</li>
		<li>Be empowered with a new, powerful, and just plain fun creative outlet</li>
</ol>

<h2> Required &nbsp; Materials </h2>

<dl>  <dt> Text: </dt>
<dd> Chris Pine&rsquo;s <span class="quote"> Learn to Program, </span>  <span class= "underline">Second Edition</span><span>.</span> </dd>
<dt> Software: </dt>
<dd> You will receive a detailed guide to setting up a development environment on your 
 Mac or Windows laptop. All required software is free. In addition, some optional 
 tools that will make your life easier have a free trial. </dd> </dl> 

<h2> Course&nbsp;Format</h2>

<p> This course is entirely project-driven. We will build a series of applications together in class. We will
start with a simple idea and learn just what we need about various technologies (HTML, CSS, Ruby,
Rails, JavaScript) to make that idea real. </p>

<p> We will then build a slightly more complicated idea, and deepen our knowledge of each topic. And then
an even more complicated idea. In this way, we will spiral across topics picking up essential, applicable
knowledge; what we&rsquo;re not going to do are deep theoretical dives into each topic, one after the other,
without ever getting to build real stuff. </p>

<p>In addition, you will build your own app idea. During the first few weeks, you will meet with an
instructor to discuss your ideas and select one that matches the scope of the course. Each week, part of
your homework will be to plug the concepts you learned in class into your app. This app will be your
final project.</p>

<p> Lectures will generally consist of the instructor demonstrating a concept and then giving the class a
challenge to practice it and think up questions. You are strongly encouraged to work in pairs during
these challenges.</p>

<h2> Expectations&nbsp;&&nbsp;Time&nbsp;Commitment</h2>

<p>This course is designed for a beginner who has never programmed before. It is our goal to make
programming accessible to as many people as possible, and dispel the mystique that surrounds it. It&lsquo;s
really possible, with passion and persistence, for a beginner to become productive very quickly with
today&rsquo;s tools. </p>

<p> Note: it&rsquo;s <span class="quote"> possible, </span> but not always <span class="quote">easy</span>. If you have never seen a line of code before, you are going to be
learning a lot of new things all at once, and so should plan to spend a significant amount of time. If you
already have some programming experience, you may have to spend less time initially while we learn
basics; but once we get into Rails, it will likely be all new to you too. </p>

<p> In short, it is not recommended to take this course if you are a completely new to programming <span class="quote">and 
</span> you have a lot of other commitments this quarter.</p>

<p> What you can expect from us in return is a lot of support. We know it's a lot, and we're here for you --
one-on-one coaching appointments, office hours, etc. We all will help each other on the class discussion
board. There is no such thing as a dumb question; we&rsquo;re all beginners here, learning together.</p>

<h2>Attendance <span style="font-size:20px"> (10% of your grade) </span> </h2>

<p> Lecture attendance is mandatory, and you are expected to be on time. To account for the vagaries of
life, you will be allowed to miss one class with no penalty. After that, 1% will be deducted from your
final grade for each unexcused absence. In addition, you will not gain access to the lecture recording of
any class you do not attend. </p>

<p> An excused absence is a documented medical emergency, religious holiday, etc. Get in touch with the
instructor immediately if you foresee any such absences. </p>

<p> Attendance of coaching appointments and office hours will be noted and may make the instructor more sympathetic when it comes to borderline grades. </p>

<h2>Homework <span style="font-size:20px"> (40% of your grade, 5% each) </span> </h2>

<p> Homeworks will be posted each week by noon on Thursday. Homeworks will generally consist of redoing
what we did together in lecture, applying that concept to a few other contexts, and then applying
it to your own app idea. </p>
<p> Homeworks will be due on Wednesday at 5pm; no exceptions, because we will often discuss homework
solutions in class. To account for the vagaries of life, you can miss one homework submission without
penalty.</p>
<p> If you want any partial credit on homeworks, you must schedule a one-on-one appointment with a
Faculty Coach to go through your solutions and discuss anything that's fuzzy. You can book up to one
30 minute appointment per week. The appointment can be remote if necessary, via Google Hangout. We
strongly recommend taking advantage of this unique resource; we are lucky to have professional
developers acting as Faculty Coaches. </p>
<p> You are allowed and encouraged to work in study groups on the homeworks, but you must type up your
final solutions yourself. In other words, no copy-pasting.</p>

<h2>Midterm <span style="font-size:20px"> (25% of your grade) </span> </h2>
<p> The midterm exam will occupy one-half of Week 7 class. It will be a practical exam; you will download
broken applications and fix them. </p>

<h2> Final&nbsp;Project <span style="font-size:20px"> (25% of your grade) </span> </h2>
<p> The final project will be to build one of your own ideas and to write a brief essay about your app and
what you learned from the process of building it. Note that if you complete all your homeworks on time,
your final project should be well underway by Week 9, and after that you just need to add polish. </p>
